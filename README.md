# TicTacToe Game

## Description
This is a simple TicTacToe game implemented using HTML, CSS (SCSS), and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. The game includes a restart button to start a new round.

- **Win Detection**: Automatically checks for winning conditions after each move.
- **Draw Detection**: Detects when the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Functionality**: A button to reset the game and start over.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with SCSS for a clean, retro-themed interface including background images and custom fonts.
